# Title - "Accessing the performance of GPU accelerated Neural network training using TensorFlow and MNIST Dataset."
-> The field of handwriting recognition is a broad area of study, which includes a comprehensive review of the main feature sets, learning data sets, and several algorithms used in this area of research. The benchmark for evaluating machine learning models is an MNIST dataset consisting of handwriting digits. This project examines and compares the efficiency and effectiveness of training neural network models on CPU and GPU environments using TensorFlow and Keras. It is possible to gain insight into the optimal operation of machine learning tasks by knowing how computational resources impact model training.
